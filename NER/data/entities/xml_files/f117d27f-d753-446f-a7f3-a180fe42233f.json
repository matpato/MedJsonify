    "contraindications_original": "Recommended Dosage\n                  \n                  Because of the varied individual responses to tranquilizers and anticholinergics, the optimum dosage of Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride and Clidinium Bromide Capsules vary with the diagnosis and response of the individual patient. The dosage, therefore, should be individualized for maximum beneficial effects. The usual maintenance dose is 1 or 2 capsules, 3 or 4 times a day administered before meals and at bedtime.\n                  \n                     Recommended Geriatric Dosage\n                  \n                  Dosage should be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia, oversedation or confusion. The initial dose should not exceed 2 Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride and Clidinium Bromide capsules per day, to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated. Elderly patients have an increased risk of dose-related adverse reactions (see \n                        PRECAUTIONS\n                     ).\n                  \n                     Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride and Clidinium Bromide Capsules\n                  \n                  To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride and Clidinium Bromide Capsules or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see \n                        WARNINGS\u00a0\n                     and \n                        DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE\n                     ).",
