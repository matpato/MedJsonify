Pull your lower eyelid downward and look up. Gently squeeze the bottle and let 1 drop fall into the space between your lower eyelid and your eye. If a drop misses your eye, repeat Step 5.\n \n                  \n                     \n                  \n                  Step 6: Replace the tan coloured cap back on the bottle and turn it clockwise to close.\n                  \n                     \n                  \n                  Step 7: Remove any extra solution from skin around the eyes with a tissue.\n                  \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                     If your doctor has told you to use drops in both eyes, repeat Step 5 for your other eye.\n                     The Ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution bottle tip is made to give a certain amount of medicine in 1 drop. \n   Do notmake the opening of the bottle tip bigger or you may get too much Ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution.\n  \n                     After you use all of the doses of Ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution that your doctor has prescribed, there will be some medicine left in the bottle.
