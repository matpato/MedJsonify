    "contraindications_original": "The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. If one dose is missed, treatment should continue with the next dose as normal.\n                  The dosage of latanoprost ophthalmic solution should not exceed once daily; the combined use of two or more prostaglandins, or prostaglandin analogs including latanoprost ophthalmic solution is not recommended. It has been shown that administration of these prostaglandin drug products more than once daily may decrease the IOP lowering effect or cause paradoxical elevations in IOP.\n                  Reduction of the IOP starts approximately 3 to 4 hours after administration and the maximum effect is reached after 8 to 12 hours.\n                  Latanoprost ophthalmic solution may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower IOP. In vitro studies have shown that precipitation occurs when eye drops containing thimerosal are mixed with latanoprost ophthalmic solution. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart. Contact lenses should be removed prior to the administration of latanoprost ophthalmic solution, and may be reinserted 15 minutes after administration.",
