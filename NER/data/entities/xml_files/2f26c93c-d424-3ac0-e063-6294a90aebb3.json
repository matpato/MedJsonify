If gastrointestinal complaints occur, administer ibuprofen tablets with meals or milk.\n                  \n                     Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, including flare-ups of chronic disease:\n                  \n                  \n                     Suggested Dosage:1200 mg to 3200 mg daily (400 mg, 600 mg or 800 mg tid or qid).
