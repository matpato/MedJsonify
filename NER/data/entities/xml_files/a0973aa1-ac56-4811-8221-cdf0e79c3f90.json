    "indications_original": "FALMINA is indicated for the use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy.\n                  \n                     Limitations of use: The efficacy of\u00a0FALMINA in women with a body mass index (BMI) of > 35 kg/m2 has not been adequately evaluated.\n                  In a clinical trial with levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, 1,477 subjects had 7,720 cycles of use and a total of 5 pregnancies were reported. This represents an overall pregnancy rate of 0.84 per 100 woman-years. This rate includes patients who did not take the drug correctly. One or more pills were missed during 1,479 (18.8%) of the 7,870 cycles; thus all tablets were taken during 6,391 (81.2%) of the 7,870 cycles. Of the total 7,870 cycles, a total of 150 cycles were excluded from the calculation of the Pearl index due to the use of backup contraception and/or missing 3 or more consecutive pills.\n                  The mean BMI of the study population was 24 kg/m2. Females with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 accounted for 12.1% (n=179) of the study population. Females with a BMI over 35 kg/m2 accounted for 4.3% (n=63) of the study population.",
