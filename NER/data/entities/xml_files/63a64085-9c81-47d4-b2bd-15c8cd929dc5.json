The usual dose of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide 75 mg/50 mg, is one tablet daily, with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see \n                        WARNINGS\n                     ). There is no experience with the use of more than one 75 mg/50 mg tablet, daily or more than two 37.5 mg/25 mg tablets, daily. Clinical experience with the administration of two 37.5 mg/25 mg tablets, daily in divided doses (rather than as a single dose) suggests an increased risk of electrolyte imbalance and renal dysfunction.\n                  Patients receiving 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide who become hypokalemic may be transferred to the 75 mg/50 mg product, directly. Patients receiving 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide who become hypokalemic may be transferred to the 37.5 mg/25 mg product, directly.\n                  In patients requiring hydrochlorothiazide therapy and in whom hypokalemia cannot be risked, therapy may be initiated with 37.5 mg/25 mg of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide. If an optimal blood pressure response is not obtained with 37.5 mg/25 mg of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide, the dose should be increased to two 37.5 mg/25 mg tablets daily as a single dose, or one 75 mg/50 mg tablet daily. If blood pressure still is not controlled, another antihypertensive agent may be added (see \n                        PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions\n                     ).\n                  \n                     \u00a0\n                  \n                  Clinical studies have shown that patients taking less bioavailable formulations of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide in daily doses of 25 mg to 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg to 100 mg of triamterene may be safely changed to one triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide 37.5 mg/25 mg tablet daily. All patients changed from less bioavailable formulations to triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be monitored clinically and for serum potassium after the transfer.",
