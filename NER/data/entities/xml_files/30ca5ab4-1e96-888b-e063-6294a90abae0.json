    "contraindications_original": "Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who areknowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. (2.1) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. (2.1 , 5) Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. (2.1) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. (2.1 , 5.2) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and making dose adjustments. (2.1 , 5.3) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient\u2019s need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose. (2.2 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4) Initiate dosing with a range of 5 to 15 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient\u2019s response to their initial doseof Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. (2.2 , 2.4) . Do not abruptly discontinue Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide.
